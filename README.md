# mmf-update-notes-proxy

[Feb 2025] 
On the `mac-mouse-fix/update-feed` branch we create html files containing update notes for each release. However, when accessing them via `raw.githubusercontent` their mime type is `text/plain` instead of `text/html`. 
This prevents them from being displayed correctly by the Sparkle update window in Mac Mouse Fix.

This repo provides a proxy which 'copies' the content of one of the update-notes html files, and then serves the content as a properly mime-typed html document.

## How It Works

The proxy:
1. Fetches the target HTML content
2. Fetches and inlines any CSS and JS resources (to bypass MIME type restrictions)
3. Serves the complete content with the correct `text/html` MIME type

## Alternative Solution:

Another solution would be to host the html files on GitHub pages directly. Then they would be served with the right mime type. But that's awkward because then we'd have to commit the GitHub page of the `mac-mouse-fix` repo entirely to the `update-feed` branch. (I think, as of [Feb 2025])

## Example Usage:
```
https://noah-nuebling.github.io/mmf-update-notes-proxy/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/update-feed/update-notes/html/en/3.0.3.html
```
